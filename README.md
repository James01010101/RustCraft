GameEngine Crate:
This is where all of the game engine specific code will be written
Testing will be done in the testing dir with the files in them.
I will create modules to hold any classes and functions that i might need
to they can be used in other crates


RustCraft Crate:
This is where i will write all of my game logic.
It will include the GameEngine itsself and run it but this isn't where i am going to be testing the game engine, that will be done in the test files.
